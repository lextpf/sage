/**
 * @class MaskedCredentialView
 * @brief Interactive masked console UI for decrypted credential triples.
 * @author Alex (https://github.com/lextpf)
 * @ingroup MaskedCredentialView
 *
 * Presents decrypted credentials as masked (`********`) rows in the
 * Windows console. Each row shows the service name in clear text and
 * the username / password fields as asterisks.
 *
 * ## :material-mouse: Interaction
 *
 * The user clicks a masked field to begin a 3-second countdown, after
 * which the real value is typed into the currently focused application
 * via `SendInput` keystroke injection (delegated to TypeSecret()).
 * Press Enter or Escape to dismiss the view.
 *
 * ## :material-console: Console State
 *
 * On construction the console input mode is saved, and mouse input is
 * enabled for hit-testing. On destruction the original mode is restored
 * automatically (RAII). Layout adapts to the current console window
 * size; entries that exceed the visible area are clipped.
 */
