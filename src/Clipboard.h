/**
 * @class Clipboard
 * @brief Static utility class for Windows clipboard operations with
 *        automatic TTL-based scrubbing of sensitive data.
 * @author Alex (https://github.com/lextpf)
 * @ingroup Clipboard
 *
 * Wraps the Win32 clipboard API behind a simple static interface.
 * Internally, an anonymous-namespace RAII guard (`ClipboardLock`)
 * manages `OpenClipboard` / `CloseClipboard` lifetime so callers
 * never need to worry about cleanup.
 *
 * ## :material-clipboard-text: Text Placement
 *
 * setText() converts a UTF-8 `std::string` to UTF-16 via
 * `MultiByteToWideChar` and places it on the clipboard as
 * `CF_UNICODETEXT`. The clipboard is emptied before writing so
 * stale data from other applications is never leaked.
 *
 * ## :material-timer-sand: TTL Scrubbing
 *
 * copyWithTTL() copies data to the clipboard and then spawns a
 * detached background thread that sleeps for a configurable
 * duration (default 6 s). When the thread wakes it performs a
 * constant-time comparison (`Cryptography::ctEqualAny`) of the current
 * clipboard content against the original value and empties the
 * clipboard only if the content is unchanged - so a manual paste
 * by the user between apps is never clobbered.
 *
 * ## :material-file-lock: Input-File Helper
 *
 * copyInputFile() reads the `sage` binary input file into memory
 * and delegates to copyWithTTL, giving CLI users a one-shot
 * "read-and-scrub" workflow.
